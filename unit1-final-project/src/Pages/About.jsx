            <h1>The rationale behind Dynamic CV</h1>
            <h2>To help applicants navigate a broken job search and recruiting process where employers struggle to identify and articulate candidate criteria as much as candidates themselves struggle with the opacity of business needs. This app disentangles contradictory demands by shifting the burden of choosing relevance to the party with the knowledge of what is relevant to them in the first place. </h2>
            <p>
                Dynamic CV (formerly Range Resume) merges the CV and personal site, aimed at career changers and job seekers with a range of interests and experiences which typical CVs struggle to convey and typical hiring managers struggle to appreciate.</p>
            
            <p> A data file larded up with  all the information one might find relevant to share    with potential employers of any kind, but filtered down by the viewer’s own priorities–embeddable as a widget in a personal site and with integrated per-section feedback forms to initiate dialogue with interested parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dynamic CV is a light-weight, unmonetized, open source application–host it, pay for your bandwidth, and modify it however you see fit.
